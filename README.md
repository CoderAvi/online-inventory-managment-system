# online-inventory-managment-system
 This is a simple inventory system created in python language using Tkinter. this is a simple gui based project where  database is used for storing information. in this system you can add , delete , update the product in your inventory using product id and also add to cart , bill generation , total product with total price , change calculation like features you can use.
 In this folder i have created two files for each and one for database. in main file , update file and add to database file you can see 2 files for each because one is .py file and other one is .py.ipynb file. basically .py.ipynb file gives you direct output if you open it in jypyter from selecting in jypyter home page all folders and choosing that main.py.ipynb file . if you want to see only code you can open .py flle in your notepad or any text editor applications.
 												main.py.inynb or main.py will show the main inventory system interface where you can search product by using product id and you can add to cart the product , make discount , calculate total , calculate changes , generate bill.
 	in add-to-database file after running you will get an interface where you can add any new product to the inventory.
 	   											in update file after running you will get an interface where you can 
 make changes in existing product in your inventory by searching their product id. i have added product id from 1 to 11 in database. if you want to search kindly 
 click from 1 to 11 any number in between.
